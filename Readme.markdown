Cappuccino Tutorial
===================

Welcome
-------

Cappuccino is an open source application framework that helps developers design and build desktop-like applications that live on the web. This project is a repository of Cappuccino resources, with the building blocks for an extended tutorial. Most of the content here has been pulled from various online resources, and merely serves the purpose of aggregating the important Cappuccino information I needed.

If you would like to learn more about Cappuccino, I encourage you to visit the projects website, [cappuccino.org](http://cappuccino.org/), as this is where the best and most up to date information resides.
