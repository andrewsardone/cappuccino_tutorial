Objective-J
-----------

Inspired by Objective-C, Objective-J is a small extension of the ECMAScript standard. The same features that Objective-C added to C, Objective-J adds to JavaScript. All of your standard JavaScript will work in Objective-J.

Let's look at a comparison between Objective-C and Objective-J.

### Similarities - Obj-C v. Obj-J

Appendix: JavaScript as a *Prototypal language*
-----------------------------------------------

Most people are familiar with *class-based* languages like Java and C++. In a class-based language, a *class* represents the design and basic functionality of an object, but no object comes to fruition until it is initialized from its class (this is known as an *instance*).

JavaScript, on the other hand, is a *prototype-based*, or *prototypal*, language . In a prototype-based language, 

> Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not present, and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in class-based languages) is performed via a process of cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes. This model can also be known as class-less, prototype-oriented or instance-based programming.
