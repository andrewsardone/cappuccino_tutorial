Cappuccino - "Cocoa for the Web"
================================

Simply put, this is "the right way to make applications, period, regardless of where they are."

Much of this content was taken from the 280North Cocoaheads presentation on March 26, 2009, available at [http://www.viddler.com/explore/cocoaheads/videos/7/](http://www.viddler.com/explore/cocoaheads/videos/7/)

What is Cappuccino
------------------

> Cappuccino is an open source application framework for developing applications that look and feel like the desktop software users are familiar with.

> Cappuccino is built on top of standard web technologies like JavaScript, and it implements most of the familiar APIs from GNUstep and Apple's Cocoa frameworks. When you program in Cappuccino, you don't need to concern yourself with the complexities of traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, or even the DOM. The unpleasantries of building complex cross browser applications are abstracted away for you.

> Cappuccino was implemented using a new programming language called Objective-J, which is modelled after Objective-C and built entirely on top of JavaScript. Programs written in Objective-J are interpreted in the client, so no compilation or plugins are required. Objective-J is released alongside Cappuccino in this project and under the LGPL.

Why the Web
-----------
**TODO**

*Brief notes from video*

*	The web is getting more and more dynamic
	*	Google Maps competes with the desktop
		*	You don't really click on any hyperlinks
*	Overtime every app is going to need a desktop, phone, and web presence


Why Cappuccino
--------------
**TODO**

*Brief notes from video*

*	Previous frameworks focus on adding some dynamic elements to static pages
*	True Desktop class web applications can't rely on rolling your own every time
	*	Put Cocoa on the web
		*	Take as much of the APIs and and put them on the web, verbatim
